# Animators

To use one of these from a client, do something like:

```sass
@use "../base/animators/rotator" as animator;

animator.$activated-styles: (color: red);
animator.$deactivated-styles: (color: blue);
animator.setup
```

## API

An `animator` should expose a `mixin` called `setup` blah blah blah
